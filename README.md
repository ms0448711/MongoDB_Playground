# Install MongoDB

I tried to install MongoDB with WSL, but I encountered a problem that cannot be resolved. ```*aborting after fassert() failure``` message appeared and seemed nobody has resolved it yet. So I changed my enviroment into Windows instead.

[Install MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/)

## Windows
### Installation
[Install MongoDB using msiexec.exe](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows-unattended/)
### Mongodb Compass
A gui program that can visualize your databases and collections. (It would ask you if you want to install it when using ```msiexec``` to install mongodb. If you skip that installation step, you can still find it at [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/compass/master/))
### MongoDB Shell
> The MongoDB Shell, mongosh, is a fully functional JavaScript and Node.js 16.x REPL environment for interacting with MongoDB deployments. You can use the MongoDB Shell to test queries and operations directly with your database.
